# Machine Learning Project: Bank Subscription Prediction

This project involves predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various client attributes. The dataset used is the "bank-full" dataset, which includes client data and the target variable indicating subscription status.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

1. **age**: Numeric age of the client
2. **job**: Type of job (categorical: admin, blue-collar, entrepreneur, housemaid, management, retired, self-employed, services, student, technician, unemployed, unknown)
3. **marital**: Marital status (categorical: divorced, married, single, unknown)
4. **education**: Education level (categorical: basic.4y, basic.6y, basic.9y, high.school, illiterate, professional.course, university.degree, unknown)
5. **default**: Credit in default (categorical: no, yes, unknown)
6. **balance**: Average yearly balance in euros (numeric)
7. **housing**: Housing loan status (categorical: no, yes, unknown)
8. **loan**: Personal loan status (categorical: no, yes, unknown)
9. **contact**: Type of communication contact (categorical: cellular, telephone)
10. **day**: Last contact day of the month (numeric 1-31)
11. **month**: Last contact month of the year (categorical: jan, feb, mar, â€¦, nov, dec)
12. **duration**: Last contact duration in seconds (numeric; note: highly affects the output target)
13. **campaign**: Number of contacts performed during this campaign (numeric)
14. **pdays**: Days since the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
15. **previous**: Number of contacts performed before this campaign (numeric)
16. **poutcome**: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: failure, nonexistent, success)
17. **target**: Subscription to a term deposit (binary: yes, no)
